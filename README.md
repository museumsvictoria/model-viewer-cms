# model-viewer-cms
Model Viewer CMS simplifies the app development workflow when developing with Google model viewer. It provides structured centralised storage for model files and associated content, and incorporates some hotspot editing functionality. It's essentially an simple CMS with a little functionality from Google's [Model Editor](https://modelviewer.dev/editor/) thrown in.

The hope is that Model Viewer CMS can help reduce the amount of back & forth between content creators and application developers during the application development phase.
